In your directory, you should download json file of web application client from google development site:
https://console.developers.google.com/cloud-resource-manager

You must enable Google Drive API and create Web client (Web Application).
credentials->OAuth 2.0 client IDs->Web client
In Authorized redirect URIs, set http://localhost:8080/
Click "DOWNLOAD JSON" to download json file and rename it to client_secrets.json.
The following command is equivalent to "ls <Google Drive directory>"
$ python oauth2_list.py
The following command deletes the target file on Google Drive.
$ python -i oauth2_delete.py

You can directly use glist.py without PyDrive.

A new delete-file function is added for PyDrive
oauth2_delete.py is a program to delete a file on Google Drive through oauth2.

The following steps are needed to be able to use the oauth2_delete.py.
1. You should install pydrive by 'pip install pydrive'.
2. You should download your .json file from google developer console and rename it to client_secrets.json.
   client_secrets.py file should be in the same folder of oauth2_delete.py.
3. Installed files.py in the original PyDrive folder should be replaced with the new one in this folder.
   Go to your pydrive folder and download files.py file on your pydrive folder
4. a new files.pyc should be generated by help.py
   To compile files.py for generating files.pyc, use help.py

$ cat help.py 
import py_compile 
py_compile.compile("files.py")

$ chmod 755 files.py
$ python help.py

The following programs will be released in this coming August 2015.
oauth2_list.py: list files on Google Drive via oauth2
oauth2_down.py: download a file from Google Drive via oauth2
oauth2_upload.py: upload a file to Google Drive via oauth2
