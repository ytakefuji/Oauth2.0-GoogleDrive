Python programs using PyDrive are able to list files on Google Drive folder (oauth2_list.py), upload file from local to Google Drive(oauth2_upload), download file from Google Drive to local (oauth2_down.py), delete file on Google Drive (oauth2_delete.py).
You should download json file of web application client from google development site:
https://console.developers.google.com/cloud-resource-manager

You must enable Google Drive API and create Web client (Web Application).
credentials->OAuth 2.0 client IDs->Web client

In Authorized redirect URIs, set http://localhost:8080/
Click "DOWNLOAD JSON" to download json file and rename it to client_secrets.json.

The following command is equivalent to "ls <Google Drive directory>"
$ python oauth2_list.py
The following command deletes the target file on Google Drive.
$ python -i oauth2_delete.py

A new delete-file function can be added for PyDrive.
The following steps are needed to be able to use the oauth2_delete.py.
1. You should install pydrive by 'pip install pydrive'.
2. You should download your .json file from google developer console and rename it to client_secrets.json.
   client_secrets.py file should be in the same folder of oauth2_delete.py.
3. Installed files.py in the original PyDrive folder should be replaced with the new one in this folder.
   Go to your pydrive folder: 
   xxx/Lib/site-packages/pydrive
   and download files.py file on your pydrive folder:
   
4. a new files.pyc should be generated by help.py
   To compile files.py for generating files.pyc, use help.py

$ cat help.py 
import py_compile 
py_compile.compile("files.py")

$ chmod 755 files.py
$ python help.py

You can directly use glist.py, gupload.py, gdownload.py, gdelete without PyDrive. 
glist.py is able to list files on Google Drive.
gupload.py can upload a file from local to Google Drive.
gdownload.py can download a file from Google Drive to local.
gdelete.py can delete a file from Google Drive.

$ python glist.py

$ python -i gupload.py

$ python -i gdownload.py

$ python -i gdelete.py
